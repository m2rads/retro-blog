## How to authenticate users in Flask using JWT tokens sent through headers?

JWT (stands for JSON web tokens) is an amazing tool for securing APIs and managing users’ logins. Flask has a JWT extension that allows you to protect your API endpoints by sending JSON Web Tokens through headers, cookies and/or query strings. This article focuses on how to send JWT through headers.

## Step 1: Installation
For your flask application to work, install Flask and flask-jwt-extended

`$ pip install Flask flask-jwt-extended`

## Step 2: Set up a Flask Server
Let’s create a simple flask server to render our login page. In the app configuration set JWT location to headers. This makes sure that only the JWT tokens that are received through request headers are processed and received. Don’t forget to set your application secret key.

```python
# Here's what you need to import
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify, json
from flask_jwt_extended import create_access_token, jwt_required, JWTManager, get_jwt_identity

# Setting up global configurations for our app
app.config["JWT_TOKEN_LOCATION"] = ["headers"]  # specifying the location of JWT
app.config["JWT_SECRET_KEY"] = "super-secret-key"

jwt = JWTManager(app)

@app.route("/index")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)
```

Be sure to import all the specified methods from the Flask library. We will need them later.

## Step 3: Set up your authentication routes
Create an endpoint to authorize users. This is where we generate new JWT tokens to send to the users. Remember to specify the request method as a post request. If a get request is sent, it will not be processed.

```python
@app.route("/auth", methods=['POST'])
def register():
    data = request.get_json()
    email = data['email']
    access_token = create_access_token(identity=email)
    return jsonify(access_token=access_token)
```

The “request” method is available for us whenever we specify an endpoint and we can use its “get_json()” method to access the data as JSON objects. Here, you can “print(data)” if you want to visualize the request data. Then we use “create_access_token” to create a JWT access token and set the “identity” property to the user’s email. Then we send the token to the user as a JSON object using “jsonify”.

## Protect a route using JWT _required
We use the “@jwt_required” function wrapper to protect an endpoint like the one below. Notice the use of the “get_jwt_identity()” method which will give us access to the username that is trying to access this resource. Note that this functionality is only available when you use the wrapper function `“@jwt_required”`.

```python 
@app.route("/protected")
@jwt_required()
def protected():
    current_user = get_jwt_identity();
    if current_user:
        return jsonify(message="welcome" + current_user)
```

Our job is done on the server-side. Let’s get to the client-side and see how we can use get a JWT token and access the protected endpoint.

## Step 4: Store the Token When Logging In
Working with JWT through headers is as simple as storing the JWT token and sending it to the server when we want to access our protected route.

Below we are sending a request to our endpoint to generate a new JWT token. Once we receive the response, we store it using JavaScript localStorage API.

```js
// sends POST request to the /auth API end-point
const register() = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  const username = document.getElementId("username");
  
  await fetch ('/login', {
        method : 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': "application/json"},
        body: JSON.stringify({username:username)
    })
    .then (response => response.json())
    .then(data => localStorage.setItem('jwt', data.access_token);)
```

Once we store the access token, we can use it to access the protected endpoints like this:

```js
cosnt accessProtected = async (e) => { 
  const options = {
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('jwt')}`,
    }
  };
  const response = await fetch('/protected', options);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data)
  return data;
}
```

Here, we are getting the JWT token that we stored from localStorage and sending it to our “protected” route to access the resources. Notice the use of “Bearer” in the authorization header. we use Bearer to indicate that we are sending an authorization token with the request so that our endpoint can process the request from the client-side.

In the end, if we console log our result, we can see the message sent from our protected route.
