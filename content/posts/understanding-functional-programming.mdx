# Understanding Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

## Core Principles

1. **Pure Functions**: Functions that given the same input, always return the same output without side effects.
2. **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed after it's created.
3. **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
4. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.

## Benefits

- **Predictability**: Pure functions make code more predictable and easier to test.
- **Concurrency**: Immutable data and lack of side effects make concurrent programming safer.
- **Modularity**: Functional code tends to be more modular and composable.

## Examples in JavaScript

```javascript
// Pure function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Higher-order function
const map = (fn, arr) => arr.map(fn);

// Function composition
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x));
```

Adopting functional programming principles can significantly improve code quality, even in languages that aren't purely functional.
